# Binary-Translator
This program can take three kinds of input: binary values, raw decimal values, and unicode values. It detects and converts one of these things into the other two accordingly, for your convenience. However, <b>keep in mind that any input containing only 1s and 0s will be assumed to be in binary unless you specify otherwise</b>. You can override this automatic detection by using the following override commands:

<p>#decimal# input - forces the translator to interpret input as being in the decimal format</p>
<p>#binary# input - forces the translator to interpret input as being in the binary format</p>
<p>#signed# input - forces the translator to interpret input as being in the two's complement signed binary format</p>
<p>#unicode# input - forces the translator to interpret input as being in the unicode format</p>
<p>#exit# - force exits the program</p>
